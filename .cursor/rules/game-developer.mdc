## Key Principles

-   **Performance First:** Write concise, technically accurate TypeScript code with a focus on performance. Optimize for efficient rendering loops (Phaser or Pixi), effective asset management, and minimal garbage collection during gameplay.
-   **Functional & Declarative Patterns:** Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless necessary for Phaser/Pixi specific implementations (e.g., `Phaser.Scene`, `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite`, `PIXI.Sprite`) or other clear benefits. Minimize reliance on global state.
-   **Resource Efficiency:** Prioritize efficient resource management and caching to ensure smooth gameplay. Minimize the creation of new objects during game loops and use recycling/pooling techniques for commonly used game objects in both Phaser and Pixi.
-   **Optimization:** Implement advanced profiling and memory management strategies to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially on mobile devices, tailored to the chosen rendering engine.

## Project Structure and Organization

-   **Modular Codebase:** Organize code into feature directories (e.g., `scenes/`, `entities/` or `gameObjects/`, `systems/` (if applicable, e.g., for ECS), `components/`, `assets/`, `utils/`, `types/`). Structure files logically: game components, scenes (Phaser/Pixi), utilities, assets management, and type definitions.
-   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage different stages (development, staging, production).
-   **Build & Deployment:** Create build scripts for bundling (e.g., using Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel) and deployment. Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments. Set up staging and canary environments to test game builds before production rollout.
-   **Component Design:** Keep Phaser Scenes/GameObjects, Pixi.js DisplayObjects, functions, and components small and focused on a single responsibility.
-   **State Management:** Avoid global state when possible; use a state management system (e.g., Zustand, Redux, or a custom solution) if needed, especially for complex applications. A centralized state management system can ease debugging.
-   **Asset Management:** Centralize all asset loading and management through a dedicated service or module (e.g., Phaser's LoaderPlugin, `PIXI.Assets`).
-   **Storage Management:** Manage all persistent storage (e.g., game saves, user settings) through a single, well-defined interface.
-   **Configuration:** Store constants (e.g., game configuration, physics parameters, tuning values) in a centralized configuration file or module (e.g., `config.ts`).

---

## Naming Conventions

-   **General:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.
-   **camelCase:** For functions and variables (e.g., `createSprite`, `playerHealth`, `createPlayer`).
-   **kebab-case:** For file names (e.g., `game-scene.ts`, `player-component.ts`).
-   **PascalCase:** For classes, Phaser Scenes/GameObjects, Pixi.js DisplayObjects, custom game object definitions, enums, and type names (e.g., `PlayerSprite`, `GameScene`, `Player`, `GameState`).
-   **Booleans:** Use prefixes like `is`, `has`, or `should` for boolean variables and functions returning booleans (e.g., `isGameOver`, `hasCollided`, `shouldRespawn`, `isLoading`).
-   **UPPERCASE:** For constants and global immutable variables (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`, `GRAVITY`, `API_BASE_URL`, `WORLD_WIDTH`).

## TypeScript, Phaser.js, and Pixi.js Best Practices

-   **TypeScript:** Leverage TypeScript's strong typing for all game objects, Phaser/Pixi elements, data structures, and function signatures to maintain clarity, predictability, and enable early error detection. Use utility types, generics, enums, and interfaces/types effectively.
-   **Phaser.js Specifics with TypeScript:**
    -   Extend Phaser classes (`Phaser.Scene`, `Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite`, etc.) using TypeScript classes.
    -   Utilize Phaser's built-in systems: Scene management, Loader plugin, Physics engines (Arcade, Matter), Animation manager, Input manager, and Event Emitter.
    -   Structure game logic within Phaser's scene lifecycle methods (`preload()`, `create()`, `update()`).
    -   Use Phaser's event system for decoupled communication between game objects and scenes.
-   **Pixi.js Specifics with TypeScript:**
    -   Follow Pixi.js's scene graph and container structure (`PIXI.Container`, `PIXI.Sprite`, `PIXI.Graphics`, etc.).
    -   Utilize `PIXI.Assets` for modern asset loading and caching.
    -   Use Pixi.js's event system (`interactive = true`, `on()`, `emit()`) for manageable event handling.
    -   Implement rendering with Pixi.js, allowing it to choose the optimal renderer (WebGPU, WebGL2, WebGL1).
-   **Efficient Object Management (Both Engines):**
    -   Integrate object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities (e.g., projectiles, particles). Phaser has Groups which can act as pools. Pixi.js has `PIXI.ParticleContainer` for specific scenarios or requires custom pooling.
    -   Regularly remove and destroy unused sprites, graphics, textures, and other display objects from the scene graph and caches to free resources and prevent memory leaks. Call `destroy()` methods.
-   **Game Loop & Ticker:**
    -   **Phaser:** Rely on the Scene's `update()` method, driven by Phaser's core game loop.
    -   **Pixi.js:** Implement a consistent game loop using Pixi.js's ticker system (`PIXI.Ticker.shared` or custom tickers).

## Phaser.js Specific Optimizations

-   **Rendering Techniques:**
    -   Optimize render calls by leveraging Phaser's internal batching.
    -   Utilize texture atlases to reduce texture swaps and draw calls.
    -   For static or rarely changing layers, consider rendering them to a `Phaser.GameObjects.RenderTexture`.
-   **Scene Management:**
    -   Use multiple Scenes wisely to split game logic, UI, and pre-render complex backgrounds or elements.
    -   Manage Scene transitions and data passing efficiently.
-   **Physics & Animation:**
    -   Choose the appropriate physics engine (Arcade for simpler, faster physics; Matter.js for more complex physics) based on game requirements.
    -   Optimize physics calculations by limiting active physics bodies, simplifying collision shapes, and updating only necessary properties. Use `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Group` for efficient collision checks.
    -   Use Phaser's Animation Manager for sprite animations; load animations from atlases.
-   **Asset Loading & Caching:**
    -   Prioritize async asset loading in `preload()` and show a loading screen. Preload critical assets.
    -   Leverage Phaser's caching mechanisms to reuse loaded assets efficiently.
-   **Event Handling:**
    -   Use Phaser's Input Manager for desktop and touch inputs seamlessly.
    -   Register and unregister events dynamically (e.g., in `create()` and `shutdown()`/`destroy()`) to prevent memory leaks.
-   **Groups and Containers:**
    -   Use `Phaser.GameObjects.Group` for managing collections of similar game objects, efficient updates, and collision checks.
    -   Use `Phaser.GameObjects.Container` to group and transform multiple game objects as a single unit.

## Pixi.js Specific Optimizations

-   **Rendering Techniques:**
    -   Optimize render calls using Pixi.js's automatic sprite batching. Use `PIXI.Container` nesting wisely.
    -   Utilize texture atlases (spritesheets) to reduce texture swaps and draw calls.
    -   Use `PIXI.ParticleContainer` for rendering large numbers of sprites that share the same base texture and have limited interactivity.
    -   For static or rarely changing parts of the scene, consider rendering them to a `PIXI.RenderTexture`.
-   **Scene Graph Management:**
    -   Properly manage the Pixi.js scene graph. Remove or destroy `DisplayObject`s when no longer needed. Call `destroy()` with appropriate options.
    -   Implement culling for off-screen objects (e.g., by setting `renderable = false` or `visible = false`).
-   **Asset Caching:** Leverage `PIXI.Assets.cache` and `PIXI.BaseTexture.defaultOptions`.
-   **Interaction Management:** Set `interactive = true` only on objects that need to respond to input. Consider event delegation.
-   **Filters and Effects:** Use Pixi.js filters mindfully; each can add render passes. Apply to containers if possible.
-   **Graphics Objects:** Cache complex `PIXI.Graphics` objects to a `PIXI.RenderTexture` if static or redrawn infrequently.

## Performance Optimization (General for TypeScript, Phaser & Pixi)

-   **Minimize Object Creation:** Aggressively use object pooling to reduce garbage collection pauses during active gameplay. Avoid allocations in tight loops (`update` methods).
-   **Efficient Particle Systems:** Implement efficient particle systems using engine-specific features (`Phaser.GameObjects.Particles.ParticleEmitter`, `PIXI.ParticleContainer`) or custom solutions.
-   **Memory Management:** For large game worlds, implement level streaming, chunk loading, or progressive asset loading. Unload assets that are no longer needed.
-   **Asset Loading & Compression:** Optimize asset loading with progressive techniques, manifest files, and compression (WebP, Basis Universal, MP3/OGG). Use pre-fetching for critical assets and lazy loading where appropriate.
-   **Responsive Assets:** Consider different asset resolutions for different devices/screen sizes.
-   **Bounds Management:** Implement efficient collision detection. Use simple geometric checks first.
-   **Data Caching:** Cache results of repeatable calculations.
-   **Web Workers:** Offload computationally intensive tasks (AI, pathfinding) to Web Workers.

## Mobile Optimization (Ionic Capacitor)

-   **Touch Controls & Gestures:** Implement responsive touch controls using Phaser's Input Manager or Pixi.js's InteractionManager. Ensure UI is touch-friendly.
-   **Responsive UI Design:** Adapt UI layouts for various screen sizes, aspect ratios, and orientations.
-   **Asset Quality & Size:** Optimize and compress assets for mobile. Use appropriate texture formats.
-   **Power Management:** Implement efficient rendering/update cycles. Reduce frame rate for static scenes if possible.
-   **Native Features via Capacitor:** Utilize Capacitor plugins for native features. Encapsulate in services.
-   **Legacy/Low-End Device Support:** Consider fallbacks: lower resolution textures, simpler effects, reduced particle counts. Both Phaser and Pixi.js have fallbacks for rendering (Canvas for Phaser if WebGL fails, WebGL1 for Pixi if newer versions not available).

---

## Web Deployment (Vercel/Cloudflare)

-   **Caching Strategies:** Leverage HTTP caching and CDNs for static assets.
-   **Progressive Loading:** Implement progressive asset loading for faster initial load and TTI.
-   **Asset Optimization for Web:** Bundle code (minification, tree-shaking, code-splitting). Compress assets. Use modern image formats.
-   **Service Workers:** Consider for advanced caching, offline support.

---

## Dependencies and External Libraries

-   **Selective Integration:** Carefully evaluate third-party libraries and Phaser/Pixi plugins.
-   **Evaluation Criteria:** Consider performance impact, compatibility, maintenance, documentation, ease of integration.
-   **Native Plugins (Capacitor):** Centralize handling within dedicated services.

---

## Advanced Techniques

-   **Custom Shaders & Filters:** Explore Phaser's (limited, often via pipelines) and Pixi.js's shader/filter capabilities for custom visual effects. Understand GLSL.
-   **Advanced Rendering:** Use multi-pass rendering (e.g., to RenderTextures) for complex visuals.
-   **Engine Gotchas & Workarounds:** Be aware of potential limitations (e.g., Pixi's vertex limits, Phaser's physics engine constraints).
-   **Object Pooling & Recycling:** Implement robust custom pooling if engine-specific solutions are insufficient.
-   **Profiling & Debugging Tools:** Use browser dev tools, Spector.js, PixiJS Devtools, Phaser Editor's debug tools.

---

## Code Structure and Organization

-   **Modular Components:** Organize into reusable modules: core engine logic (if abstracting), scene management, entity systems (ECS), UI, services.
-   **State Management:** Implement or use a robust state system for global game state.
-   **Design Patterns:** Apply relevant patterns (Observer, Command, State, Factory, ECS).
-   **Error Handling:** Centralize error logging; integrate crash reporting.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

-   **Automated Testing:** Unit tests (Jest, Vitest) for logic, systems. Integration tests for scene interactions. Mocks for services/plugins.
-   **Performance Testing:** Automated tests for FPS, draw calls, memory. Regular profiling.
-   **Cross-Platform/-Device Testing:** Test on various devices, browsers, OSs (emulators and real devices).
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated builds, tests, static analysis, deployments.
-   **Error Management & Reporting:** Global error handlers. Crash reporting services (Sentry, Bugsnag).
-   **Analytics & Playtesting:** In-game analytics. Regular playtesting for balance, UX, bugs.
